Bella Poarch is a TikTok sensation with over 80 million followers, making her the third most-followed account on the platform. Her lip-synch videos have garnered billions of likes while her pop music career has taken off at an impressive pace. Her hit song, "Build A B*tch," tackles misogynistic themes, and "Living Hell" is a raw portrayal of the abusive childhood she endured in the Philippines. In an interview with Vevo Footnotes, Bella reveals that the color yellow is associated with her traumatic past, and "Living Hell" is an extremely cathartic song for her.
